Core Pipeline Architecture (Importance: 95)

Main 5-stage processing pipeline with sequential data flow:

1. Chunking Stage
- Input: Raw text/markdown documents
- Output: XML-structured chunks with semantic boundaries
- Component: malmo_chunker.py, chunker.py
- Handles document segmentation and structure preservation

2. Entity Processing Stage  
- Input: Chunked XML content
- Output: XML with tagged named entities (<nei> tags)
- Component: malmo_entitizer.py, entitizer.py
- Processes named entities with pronunciation metadata

3. Speech Enhancement Stage
- Input: Entity-tagged XML
- Output: XML with speech enhancement markup
- Component: malmo_orator.py, orator.py
- Adds speech timing, emphasis, and emotional markers

4. Tone Adjustment Stage
- Input: Enhanced XML
- Output: XML with normalized emphasis
- Component: malmo_tonedown.py, tonedown.py
- Normalizes entity pronunciation and emphasis patterns

5. Speech Synthesis Stage
- Input: Processed XML
- Output: Audio files via ElevenLabs
- Component: malmo_11labs.py, elevenlabs_converter.py
- Converts to final TTS format and generates speech

Key Data Flow Characteristics (Importance: 85)

1. Sequential Dependencies
- Each stage requires completion of previous stage
- Maintains processing state between stages
- Preserves partial progress on failures
- Enables resumption from any stage

2. State Preservation
- Records completed steps and attempt counts
- Tracks entity pronunciation dictionary
- Maintains chunk processing progress
- Preserves model parameters between runs

3. Data Transformations
- XML structure preserved through all stages
- Progressive enhancement of speech markup
- Entity tracking across document chunks
- Emphasis and timing marker coordination

4. Error Recovery Paths
- Fallback processing options at each stage
- State restoration on pipeline failures
- Partial results preservation
- Processing resumption capabilities
