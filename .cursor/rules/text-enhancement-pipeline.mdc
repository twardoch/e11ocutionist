Core 5-Stage Text Enhancement Pipeline (Importance: 95)
Located in `legacy_src/malmo_all.py` and `src/e11ocutionist/e11ocutionist.py`

1. Chunking Stage
- Semantic boundary detection for document segmentation 
- Hierarchical organization: doc -> chunks -> units -> items
- Chapter and scene transition identification
- Minimum semantic unit requirements (5 units per chunk)

2. Entity Processing Stage
- Language-specific entity detection 
- Pronunciation mapping with <nei> tags
- Tracks new vs existing entities
- Domain-aware entity classification (people, locations, etc.)

3. Oration Enhancement Stage
- Sentence restructuring for natural speech flow
- Word normalization (numbers to text)
- Punctuation enhancement for pauses
- Emotional markup tagging
- Strategic pause insertion with <hr/> tags

4. Tone Adjustment Stage
- Emphasis control with minimum spacing rules
- Pronunciation refinement based on language context
- Entity pronunciation guidance optimization
- NEI tag review and simplification

5. Voice Generation Stage
- Dialog transformation for TTS
- Quote normalization and standardization
- Break timing markers
- ElevenLabs-specific markup formatting

Speech Enhancement Rules (Importance: 85)
Located in `legacy_src/malmo_orator.py`

1. Text Structure Enhancement
- Parenthetical expression handling with ellipses
- Strategic dash/hyphen conversion to pause markers
- Symbol resolution (/, &) with language awareness
- Paragraph-level emotional emphasis

2. Dialog Processing
- Em dash conversion to speech-friendly markers
- Nested dialog handling with <q> tags
- Dialog state tracking
- Quote standardization for TTS

3. Emotional Markup
- Context-aware emphasis placement
- Dramatic pause insertion
- Emotional delivery tags
- Speech pacing control
