# entity-processing-model

The entity processing system implements specialized Named Entity Interest (NEI) recognition and management with domain-specific rules for text-to-speech optimization.

Core Components (Importance: 95):

1. Entity Recognition Pipeline
- Language detection and context analysis for entity relevance
- Special domain handling for scientific terms (species, genes, proteins)
- Progressive entity discovery with state preservation
- Entity categorization based on type (people, locations, organizations)

2. Pronunciation Mapping System (Importance: 90)
- Custom transcription rules for entity pronunciations
- Language-specific palatalization handling (e.g., Polish "i" rules)
- Syllable splitting with hyphenation markers
- Abbreviation and acronym expansion with phonetic mapping

3. Entity Dictionary Management (Importance: 85)
- Maintains running dictionary of discovered entities
- Tracks entity history for consistent pronunciation
- Case-sensitive storage with case-insensitive lookup
- Batch processing support for token limit management

XML Schema Implementation (Importance: 80):
```
<nei orig="[original]" new="[boolean]">
  [pronunciation]
</nei>
```

Business Rules:

1. Entity Processing (Importance: 85)
- Only complete words/phrases can be tagged as entities
- No nested NEI tags within existing XML structures
- Original document structure and whitespace preservation
- Minimum 25 NEIs per batch for pronunciation review

2. Pronunciation Guidance (Importance: 80)
- Foreign terms require phonetic approximation
- Technical terms get specialized pronunciation rules
- Initialisms use period/space separation
- Entity case preservation with standardized lookup

- Utilities: src/e11ocutionist/neifix.py
